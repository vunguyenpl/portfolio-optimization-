This is my first ever financial python project on optimizing portfolio using Markowitz theory, the portfolio is made up by 4 most popular pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' stock starting from 2019. I used pandas, numpy, and matplotplib libraries. I have simplified the script in the most clear cut way I could, feel free to implement it.
